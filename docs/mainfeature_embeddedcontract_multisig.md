## Multi-Signature
- The purpose of the multi-signature is to increase security by requiring multiple parties to reach a consensus on a transaction before execution.
- The multi-signature contract provides the seamless ability to **change blockReward for the miner**.
- The multi-signature contract provides the seamless ability to **mint US2 coins to the custody contract**.
- Submit & Confirm transaction is executed **by only the US2 operator**.
